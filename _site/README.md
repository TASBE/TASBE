# Installation

 This project is intended to be run using either Matlab or Octave. More information regarding the installation process can be found [here](docs/installation.md).
 
# Workflow

 The recommended workflow for using the TASBE package is to process your data in three stages: 
 
   1. Creation of a ColorModel which translates raw FCS data to comparable unit data. <br /> 
   2. Using the created ColorModel for batch processing of experimental data. <br /> 
   3. Comparison and plotting of the results from analysis.  
 
Example files are provided that show how these stages typically work.

## Excel Interface
The workflow described above has been consolidated into a new Excel interface feature that provides a user-friendly bridge between raw FCS data and current TASBE data analysis tools. Users can document important aspects of their experiments without having to worry about writing Matlab code. More information can be found [here](docs/Excel_README.md).
